This is the _Flathub Release_ repository of [GnuCash's Flatpak repository](https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash-on-flatpak) only.
There the real work is done and you should create your _Pull Requests_ there, too.
There is also a separate [Bug tracker](https://bugs.gnucash.org/buglist.cgi?component=Flatpak&product=Packaging).
